                <article id="ceucr" class="anchor research-section">
                  <h3>1. Community-Engaged Urban Climate Resilience</h3>
                  <p class="lead-intro">The primary objective is to co-produce actionable knowledge and multi-scale evidence with residents and partners that aligns lived experience with hydrologic and spatial analysis, builds shared capacity, and converts insight into plans and policies that strengthen small- and large-scale climate resilience.</p>

                  <h4>Community-based approaches to UPF research</h4>
                  <p>In my PhD research, I explored ways of engaging residents when dealing with urban pluvial flooding (UPF). Reviewing community-based approaches to UPF, Azizi et&nbsp;al. (2022) argue that typical multi-disciplinary frameworks are not able to fully capture its multi-dimensional complexity as a socio-environmental system. A common shortcoming is that, in many cases, studies are conceived as a one-way process, with residents involved only (or mostly) in collecting data for the “flooding experts.” This low level of engagement affords little opportunities for a deeper, collective learning process, which could effect changes to inveterate power structures and decision-making/funding processes.</p>
                  <p>Another gap identified in Azizi et&nbsp;al. (2022) is that little has been done in terms of incorporating residents’ knowledge in the development/improvement of urban flood models, which could be especially relevant in sectors with limited data availability for hydrodynamic modeling. A criticism of some of the “green approaches” is their focus on high-tech, proprietary innovations that are not applicable to low-resourced contexts.</p>
                  <p>As a result, it is proposed that a new paradigmatic shift is needed that accounts not only for the technical/scientific aspects, but also for the interacting political, social, and economic conditions that drive UPF locally. This recognizes that our capacity to tackle UPF hinges on individual behaviors and decision-making, which in turn depend on formal and informal power structures. In any given neighborhood, the risk of UPF as well as the likely range of interventions correlate with the community’s capacity to mobilize and effect actions. We can foster these by involving residents at all stages of the UPF issue, from problem definition to management, and by increasing their knowledge about UPF, while also incorporating their previous flooding experiences as well as their needs when assessing and responding to this issue. Fig.&nbsp;1 summarizes the review by Azizi et&nbsp;al. (2022).</p>

                  <p>As an example of a participatory UPF methodology, Azizi et&nbsp;al. (2023) engaged residents from Germantown, a suburban city in Tennessee that suffered a serious flooding event in 2019. A hydrologic–hydrodynamic modeling exercise was integrated with community-based data collection at three levels of engagement (Fig.&nbsp;2), with the goals of (i) addressing data gaps in a flooding model, (ii) engaging neighbors in a reciprocal learning process, (iii) improving UPF modeling, and (iv) enhancing residents’ understanding of their own flooding risk. Qualitative, community-based observations helped improve the basin model, while the deeper, multi-level engagement process allowed for bi-directional learning, resulting in enhanced UPF resilience.</p>

                  <p>The effective application of citizen-science approaches to address current issues in UPF research is a challenging task. In this study, we approached several of these challenges with a systematic, multi-phase community-engagement process that collected detailed residents’ observations of UPF variables of interest. Even though the results were case-specific, the methodology is transferable to other localities and could be effectively applied in various contexts. However, each case will have its own unique characteristics that need to be considered.</p>
                  <p>One specific issue that should be considered when applying our approach is <em>timing</em>: engagement can occur after an extreme event has already occurred locally or when it has not occurred (yet). This factor can significantly alter how research should proceed as well as the initial level of interest from residents. As proposed in Fig.&nbsp;3, when reaching out to residents after an extreme event, they might be more willing to participate in the research in general—and data collection in particular—while the impacts and fresh memories of a recent flood are still lingering. This provides an opportunity to start with a lower level of engagement (as performed in this study) and increase it as the research process progresses. In our case, the past event provided a focal point to initiate the conversation with residents.</p>

                    <figcaption><strong>Fig. 3.</strong> Engagement process with the community based on the timing of the study, i.e., whether reaching out to residents before (red) or after (blue) an extreme event has happened in the neighborhood.</figcaption>
                  </figure>

                  <p>When the research involves a locality where no large flood has occurred yet (according to local memory), it becomes much more important to establish a high level of engagement from the beginning and maintain it through the process. To motivate people, engagement processes should highlight the importance of UPF, bringing it to their attention—e.g., noting recent UPF events in nearby locations. Citizen participation and motivation are primary requirements for citizen-science programs to succeed. The most significant challenge we faced when applying our proposed methodology was accessing a sufficiently large number of residents and engaging them across the data-collection phases. These are vital aspects when attempting to effect meaningful impacts on rainfall–runoff modelling over larger catchments. One option to increase participation and willingness is to engage local organizations and work with community leaders. This can improve acceptance of the project and enable researchers to reach larger numbers of residents.</p>
